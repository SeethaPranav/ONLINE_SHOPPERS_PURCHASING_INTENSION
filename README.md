# ONLINE_SHOPPERS_PURCHASING_INTENSION
Predicting online shopper purchase intent using machine learning models and feature engineering on website interaction data.

## OVERVIEW
This project aims to develop a predictive model to forecast whether an online shopper will generate revenue based on their browsing behavior on an e-commerce website. The model utilizes a dataset containing various features related to user interactions, including page views, time spent on pages, and other behavioral metrics.

## DATASET
The dataset used for this project is called `online_shoppers_intention.csv`, containing the following columns:

- **Administrative**: Number of administrative pages viewed
- **Administrative_Duration**: Total time spent on administrative pages
- **Informational**: Number of informational pages viewed
- **Informational_Duration**: Total time spent on informational pages
- **ProductRelated**: Number of product-related pages viewed
- **ProductRelated_Duration**: Total time spent on product-related pages
- **BounceRates**: Percentage of single-page visits
- **ExitRates**: Percentage of exits from the site
- **PageValues**: Average value of a page based on the revenue generated
- **SpecialDay**: Indicates if the visit occurred on a special day (e.g., holiday)
- **Month**: Month of the visit
- **OperatingSystems**: The operating system used by the visitor
- **Browser**: The browser used by the visitor
- **Region**: The region where the visitor is located
- **TrafficType**: Type of traffic (e.g., direct, referral)
- **VisitorType**: Whether the visitor is a new or returning visitor
- **Weekend**: Indicates if the visit occurred on a weekend
- **Revenue**: Target variable indicating whether the visitor made a purchase

## FUTURE WORK
- **Continuous Model Monitoring:** It is essential to continually evaluate the model’s performance with new incoming data to ensure it remains accurate and reliable. Regular monitoring can identify shifts in data distributions or emerging patterns that may require adjustments.
  
- **Feature Engineering and Selection:** The process of feature engineering and selection should be revisited periodically, especially after analyzing model predictions. Gaining insights from the current performance may reveal opportunities to refine existing features or introduce new ones, enhancing the model's predictive power.

- **Data Collection and Quality Assurance:** Maintaining high-quality, consistent data collection methods is crucial for both the training and unseen datasets. Any changes in the data collection process should be tracked, and efforts should be made to reduce noise, ensure data consistency, and remove outliers that may negatively impact model performance.

- **Model Retraining and Updates:** As consumer behavior evolves over time, it is important to periodically retrain models using fresh data to ensure they remain relevant and accurate. This practice can help the model adapt to new trends and changing patterns in user behavior.

- **Exploration of Advanced Algorithms:** In addition to the current approach, exploring more sophisticated models, such as deep learning algorithms (e.g., neural networks), may yield higher accuracy. Techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) could be tested for further improvements in prediction performance.

- **Addressing Data Imbalances:** The model’s performance may be impacted by imbalanced classes in the data. To address this, resampling techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or class weighting should be considered to create a more balanced dataset and improve prediction accuracy.

- **Enrichment of Features:** Expanding the feature set could increase the model’s ability to make more informed predictions. Adding new data points, such as demographic information, behavioral metrics, or transaction history, may offer additional context that can improve classification results.

- **Ensemble Methods:** Exploring ensemble techniques, such as Random Forests, XGBoost, or Stacking, could further enhance the model’s robustness and accuracy. Combining the strengths of multiple models may help address weaknesses inherent in any single model.

- **Model Interpretability:** As model complexity increases, ensuring interpretability becomes more crucial. Investigating tools like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) could help make the model's predictions more transparent and understandable, providing insights into which features are most influential.

- **Real-time Predictions and Scalability:** For future implementations, consider scaling the model to handle real-time predictions, allowing for dynamic adjustments to the visitor classification as data flows in. Exploring cloud-based solutions or distributed computing could improve scalability and processing speed.

By integrating these strategies into future work, the model can evolve to better capture trends, provide more accurate predictions, and adapt to the changing landscape of consumer behavior.
